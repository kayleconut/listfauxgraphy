# Listfauxgraphy

I used to use Listography pretty intensely because I like making lists, but it's limiting in a lot of aspects and looks like shit on a phone. Fortunately, I also like making things unnecessarily complicated for myself. Ergo, this. Thank you to [Desert Jaguar](http://desertjaguar.casa) for the idea!

## Dependencies

Requires dragula.js/dragula.css for the drag-and-drop feature (already included in folder).


## Usage notes

    *   The list template is located in `template.txt`. Copy it and paste it into the column of your choice (columns are labelled)
    *   Icons are optional. If you don't want to use them, just remove the image.
    *   List background colors are determined by the classes `color1` through `color5` on each section. You need to pick a class or the list won't have a background!
    *   You can edit all the colors in the CSS out of the variables section at the beginning. You can also change the font family.
        *   More advanced changes will need to be made in the CSS itself, which is commented.
    *   You can add "ongoing" and "archive" pages by duplicating this page and linking to them in the navigation. Or change the links to something different!
    *   List titles link to the anchor point on this page, so you can share lists by copying that link.
    *   Upload everything in this folder except `template.txt` to whatever website directory you want.
    *   Have fun and email me any questions if they arise!
